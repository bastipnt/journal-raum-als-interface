Today I tried setting up the 
AR glasses.
Learnings: 
it gets HOT. like dangerously hot. I don't think people could wear that for 30 minutes.

you need this app installed :
https://resources.magicleap.com/en-us/downloads
It's called The Lab, it installs all the stuff for you.

Further, you need unity and its AR Core. 
that is most easily installed with unity hub

- the glasses don't like eduroam wifi and refuse to connect to any of the free wifi. a wired connection, here we come.
- the glasses have all kinds of sensors and play nicely with unity. 
- seems like the lumin SDK is obligatory. it can be installed from within the Lab
