First learnings with the [Magic Leap One](https://www.magicleap.com/ml1-devices):

- the glasses get HOT...
- we need a specific [app](https://resources.magicleap.com/en-us/downloads) to install, The Lab
- [unity](https://unity.com/download) + AR Core (AR Foundation) need to be installed
- the glasses don't like eduroam wifi and refuse to connect to any of the free wifi. a wired connection, here we come.
- the glasses have all kinds of sensors and play nicely with unity.
- seems like the lumin SDK is obligatory. it can be installed from within the Lab

[Here](https://github.com/stuurge/dreamfusion-vr), somebody successfully imported automatic import of Dreamfusion objects into unity
