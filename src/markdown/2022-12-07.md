Trying to answer the 5 'W'-questions regarding our project:

**What**? Display and modify 'auras' of objects, aura = energy body, radiation, (to ancient Greek αὔρα 'breath of air')

**Why**? Subjectifying objects that make up a room, creating conversation pieces, making the temporal component of space visible => critical examination of the conservative, absolute definition of spaces and rooms, related to the question: to what extent do objects shape spaces?

**When**? Always

**Who**? Possible in every room

**How**? AR → Augmentation by making the invisible visible, expansion of both consciousness and perception
